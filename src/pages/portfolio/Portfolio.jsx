						<p>I am experimenting with 2 techniques: offline methods, where I
							use output from confused signs such as in/above to train separate models,
							and online methods, where certain states can be segmentally boosted
							during training to have more weight in recognizing the sign. 
							The image below shows the joint hierarchy from which we must selectively 
							produce meaningful features.
